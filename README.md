# Personal Website

[Check it out for yourself!](https://www.brandon-nolan.ca)

This is the repository for my personal website! Here is the stack.

### Front-End
* React JS
* Material UI
* Axios
  
### Back-End
* Node JS
* Express
* OAuth2

I've always wanted my own site, and now I do! This was a great learning experience for sure. I learned a lot about React, and the whole deployment process of a website. 
Previously, I've used dedicated hosting platforms (GoDaddy etc.) for sites I've built in the past and this is the first time I've managed things myself. I'm hosting my site in a droplet provided by the folks at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com). 

Leveraging FlightPlan, the deployment process of my site is super quick and easy. I'm able to push any changes made in seconds!
